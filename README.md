This repository contains my Applied DS Lab work developed as part of the WorldQuant University (WQF) curriculum.

The goal of this lab was to build practical data science and quantitative finance skills by implementing concepts from scratch, experimenting with real datasets, and developing reusable analytical workflows in Python.

This DS Lab focuses on:
  Applying data science fundamentals to financial and non-financial datasets
  Building clean, modular, and reproducible Python code
  Developing intuition for statistical analysis, time series, and ML concepts
  Translating theory into working notebooks, scripts, and mini-projects

Tools & Technologies
  Python
  Pandas, NumPy
  Matplotlib / Seaborn
  Scikit-learn
  Jupyter Notebook
