💼 Bankruptcy in Poland

Project Overview
This project develops a **machine learning model to predict corporate bankruptcy** using real-world financial data from Polish companies. The focus is on handling messy, imbalanced financial datasets and building robust classification models that prioritize meaningful business outcomes.

---

Objective
Predict the likelihood of company bankruptcy using financial indicators, with emphasis on handling **imbalanced data** and optimizing **precision and recall**.
