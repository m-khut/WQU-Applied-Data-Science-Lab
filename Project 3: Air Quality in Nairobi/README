🌍 Air Quality Time Series Analysis (Africa)

In this project, air quality data from **one of Africa’s largest open data platforms, OpenAfrica**, is used to analyze **PM2.5 pollution levels** in major African cities, including **Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam**.

Key areas of focus include:
 - Working with real-world environmental time series data  
 - Analyzing temporal trends and daily patterns in PM2.5 levels  
 - Building and evaluating time series forecasting models  
 - Interpreting predictions for urban air quality insights  

Objective
 - The project focuses on building **time series models** to predict PM2.5 readings throughout the day, with an emphasis on understanding temporal patterns in air pollution data.

Skills & Concepts covered

 - Libraries
    - Numpy
    - Pandas
    - SciKit-Learn
    - Plotly
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn (for heatmap)
