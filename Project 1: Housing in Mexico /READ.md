🏠 Housing in Mexico Price Analysis

Project Overview:
This project analyzes 21,000+ residential property listings in Mexico sourced from Properati.com to answer a core real-estate and data-science question:
  Are housing prices influenced more by property size or by location?
Using structured data analysis and exploratory techniques, the project investigates how these two factors relate to sale prices and which has a stronger impact.

Objective

  Evaluate the relationship between location and sale price
  Compare both effects to determine which factor is more influential
