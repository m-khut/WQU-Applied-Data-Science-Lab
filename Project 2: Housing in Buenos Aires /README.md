🏙️ Predicting Housing Prices in Buenos Aires

This project explores **real-world housing data from Buenos Aires** and applies end-to-end data science workflow skills to **build predictive models for property prices**.

It focuses on learning how to:
 - Clean and prepare housing datasets for modeling
 - Explore relationships between features and price
 - Build and evaluate predictive models
 - Apply lessons in a final assignment-style notebook workflow

Objective
 - Build models that predict **property sale prices** using available listing features, starting with the most intuitive driver:

Lesson 1: Predicting Price with Property Size
 - Focus:
   - Understanding the relationship between **property size** and **price**
   - Establishing a baseline feature for prediction
   - Work with feature (X) and train (y)
   - Building intuition for modeling using a single strong variable

Lesson 2: Predicting Price with Property Location
 - Focus:
   - Representing property location in a usable analytical format
      - 3-D data plotting
   - Comparing prices across different neighborhoods or regions  
   - Evaluating how location improves price prediction accuracy
   - Example graph

Lesson 3: Predicting Price with Property Neighborhood
 - Focus:
   - Handling categorical neighborhood features  
   - Encoding neighborhood information for modeling  
   - Measuring how neighborhood-level detail improves predictions
       - Ridge Regression
   - Example graph

Lesson 4: Building a Comprehensive Price Prediction Model
 - Focus:
   - Combining multiple features (size, location, neighborhood) into a single model
   - Handling categorical neighborhood features
   - Encoding neighborhood information for modeling
   - Measuring how neighborhood-level detail improves predictions
