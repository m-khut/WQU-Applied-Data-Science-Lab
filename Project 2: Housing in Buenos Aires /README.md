🏙️ Predicting Housing Prices in Buenos Aires

This project explores **real-world housing data from Buenos Aires** and applies end-to-end data science workflow skills to **build predictive models for property prices**.

It focuses on learning how to:
 - Clean and prepare housing datasets for modeling
 - Explore relationships between features and price
 - Build and evaluate predictive models
 - Apply lessons in a final assignment-style notebook workflow

Objective
 - Build models that predict **property sale prices** using available listing features, starting with the most intuitive driver:

Skills & Concepts Covered
 - Data wrangling and preprocessing
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Feature/target relationships
 - Predictive modeling fundamentals
 - Model evaluation and iteration
 - Notebook-based workflow (lesson → practice → assignment)


Lesson 1 — Predicting Price with Property Size
 - Focus:
   - Prepare Data
      - Import
      - Explore
      - Split
   - Build Model
      - Baseline
      - Iterate
      - Evaluate
   - Communicate Results
   - Understanding the relationship between **property size** and **price**
   - Establishing a baseline feature for prediction
   - Work with feature (X) and train (y)
   - Building intuition for modeling using a single strong variable

Lesson 2 — Predicting Price with Property Location
 - Focus:
   - Representing property location in a usable analytical format  
   - Comparing prices across different neighborhoods or regions  
   - Evaluating how location improves price prediction accuracy
